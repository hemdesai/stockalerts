# Session Summary: Repository Cleanup and Replit Preparation

## Date: 2025-07-25

## Overview
This session focused on cleaning up the stockalerts repository and preparing it for Replit deployment after implementing the complete HE Alerts system.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. System Architecture Simplification
- **Removed unnecessary tables**: Deleted `alert_logs`, `email_logs`, and `alerts` tables
- **Implemented delete-before-insert strategy**: Each category is cleared before inserting new data to prevent stale entries
- **Single table design**: Simplified to just the `stocks` table for easier maintenance

### 2. Repository Cleanup
- **Removed 75+ files**: Deleted test files, debug scripts, temporary fixes, CSV exports, validation reports, and downloaded images
- **Freed ~7,781 lines** of temporary/development code
- **Organized remaining files**: Moved diagnostic scripts to `scripts/diagnostics/`
- **Updated .gitignore**: Added patterns to prevent future clutter

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` with comprehensive diagrams
- Created `docs/FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` with detailed Mermaid diagrams
- Updated main `README.md` to show both HE Alerts and legacy systems
- Created `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step instructions

### 4. Replit Preparation
- Added `.replit` configuration file
- Added `replit.nix` for environment setup
- Configured for automatic scheduling (AM: 9:00 EST, PM: 3:30 EST)

## Current System Status

### HE Alerts Features
1. **Email Processing**: Fetches Daily and Crypto emails from Gmail
2. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Daily: HTML table parsing
   - Crypto: OCR from images at indices 6 & 14
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with delete-before-insert strategy
4. **Price Updates**: IBKR integration via ib_async
5. **Alert Generation**: Sentiment-based rules (BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
6. **Validation Workflow**: Can review data before DB updates

### Alert Rules
- **BULLISH**: BUY if price ≤ buy_trade, SELL if price ≥ sell_trade
- **BEARISH**: BUY if price ≥ buy_trade, SELL if price ≤ sell_trade
- **NEUTRAL**: Same as BULLISH

### Key Files
- **Main workflow**: `he_alerts/alert_workflow.py`
- **Email fetcher**: `he_alerts/fetch_latest_emails.py`
- **Validation**: `he_alerts/validate_emails.py` (dry run)
- **Scheduler**: `he_alerts/scheduled_alerts.py`

## Repository Structure
```

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/db
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/to/credentials.json
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key
IBKR_HOST=127.0.0.1
IBKR_PORT=7497
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_USERNAME=email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=app-password
ALERT_FROM_EMAIL=alerts@domain.com
ALERT_TO_EMAILS=["recipient@email.com"]
```

## Important Notes
1. **Repository URL**: https://github.com/hemdesai/stockalerts (with 's')
2. **Crypto extraction**: Must use images 6 and 14 for correct data
3. **TSLA in ideas**: Was completely fabricated and has been removed
4. **Validation first**: Always run validate_emails.py before fetch_latest_emails.py

## Deployment Steps
1. Import https://github.com/hemdesai/stockalerts to Replit
2. Configure Secrets with environment variables
3. Run `python he_alerts/scripts/init_db.py`
4. Test with `python he_alerts/alert_workflow.py --test-mode`
5. Enable Always On for scheduled execution

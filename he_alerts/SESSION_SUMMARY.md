2. **Price Updates**: IBKR connection working, ready for scheduled updates
3. **Alert Detection**: Buy/Sell alerts triggering based on thresholds
4. **API Access**: RESTful endpoints available for monitoring

## ðŸ“‹ Next Session: Alert Generation System

### Objective
Build the alert generation and email sending system based on `5_send_alerts.py`

### Requirements
1. Generate formatted alert emails when price thresholds are crossed
2. Send alerts via Gmail SMTP
3. Track sent alerts to avoid duplicates
4. Support both individual and batch alert sending
5. Include market context and sentiment in alerts

### Key Components to Build
1. Alert email formatter (HTML templates)
2. Alert aggregation service (group by session)
3. Email sending service (SMTP integration)
4. Alert deduplication logic
5. API endpoints for alert management

### Reference Implementation
- `stockalert/scripts/5_send_alerts.py` - Original alert sending logic
- Uses Gmail SMTP for sending
- Tracks sent alerts in database
- Formats alerts with buy/sell recommendations

## ðŸ’¾ Backup Checklist
- âœ… All code committed to repository
- âœ… Database has 80 stocks with correct data
- âœ… 13 stocks have current AM prices
- âœ… Alert logs table created and ready
- âœ… IBKR connection settings documented
- âœ… Session summary saved

## ðŸš€ To Start Next Session

1. Review this summary
2. Check `stockalert/scripts/5_send_alerts.py` for alert logic
3. Focus on building the alert generation module
4. Test with existing price data and thresholds

The system is now ready for the final component: automated alert generation and sending!
